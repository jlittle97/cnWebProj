This website was made as part of a course with Code Nation.  Before joining code nation I had experience coding in python as part of my study at the University of Manchester; I would use it to analyse and present experimental data on my Mathematics and Physics course.  I applied for the Code Nation course as I wanted to expand my coding knowledge beyond that which I had learnt at university.  The course gave me this option as well as helping me to find employment in a field in which I have a keen interest, that being the technology sector.  Doing the course taught me many new skills as well as to flex those which I already had.  They taught us how to use HTML and CSS to create a website (this one to be precise) as well as how to use javascript to create an alert/prompt text game.  The latter of which was created as a group project in which I took on a leadership role, delegating tasks to the members of our group in order to capitalise on everyone's strengths and weaknesses.  Time management was another very important skill during the course due to the short nature of it and the scale of the projects we were given.
