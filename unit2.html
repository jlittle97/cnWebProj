        <h3>
            1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page
        </h3>
        <p>
            The content of the website was instructed in the brief of the project to be answers to the questions asked of us.  I wanted this content to be laid out across different pages depending on the section of the project it corresponded so as to not make the pages too information dense.  I wanted a navigation bar at the top of every page to allow for easy navigation around the website and to allow for jumping to different question sections.  After seeing some examples that were quite messy I decided I wanted the layout to be clean and consistent making reading the website easy.  I wanted plenty of space around the content, once again so as to not make it too information dense.
        </p>
        <h3>
            1.2 Plan and create your website
        </h3>
        <p>
            The first step in planning the website was to create the content for it.  Once I had a significant portion of the content I began to consider how I wanted it to appear visually and began working on things I wanted to remain constant throughout the project such as the background image, the navigation bar, and the text appearance.  After that came the more individual features such as how the text is lower on the home page and the jump points in each page.  Once I had a template I was happy with I began to copy the content in, making sure that everything still looked the way I wanted as I went.  Once all the content was implemented I cleaned things up a bit by adjusting padding and margin spaces until the website looked as good as I could make it in the context of the template I had created.
        </p>
        <h3>
            1.3 Selecting and using web site features and structure
        </h3>
        <p>
            I felt that there was no need to reinvent the wheel with this project and so I wanted to include a navigation bar at the top of the page to allow for easy navigation of the website, I fixed it in place so that it remains at the top of the page when scrolling so that no matter where you are in the page you can navigate to a different one easily.  Another feature I wanted was the ability to jump to certain outcomes instead of having to scroll all the way down from the top of the page.
        </p>
        <h3>
            1.4 Selecting and using styles to keep your site consistent
        </h3>
        <p>
            As can been seen by browsing the website I used the same style throughout.  I did this as I believe that a consistent website makes it clear that it all belongs together while also looking clean and professional, two things I strived to achieve throughout the project.  The style I chose features an identical navigation bar on each page with an indicator to let the reader know what page they are currently on.  I knew I wanted the text to be fairly central to allow ease of reading whilst also not forcing the reader to scroll regardless of the size of their monitor or window, which is why I chose to use percentage values as much as possible when it came to defining the width of elements.  I initially considered having a plain background, however I found this to be too dull instead opting for a photograph I took as a part of my GCSE Art coursework and using a transparent background under the text to enhance readability while still allowing for the interesting features of the background to be visible.

        <h3>
            1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites
        </h3>
        <p>
            Copyright is one of the largest constraints on any digital project as the end result will be visible globally allowing for easy spotting of any copyright infringement.  When creating a website for a third party it is important that all parties understand who will own what when the final result is published, and in the case of crediting the developer allowing them to reserve the right to remove credit should the project become something they no longer wish to have their name attached to.  When a website contains a significant number of high value images, for example in the case of a photographer's portfolio it may be wise to consider watermarking images as a way to deter people from using the images without the correct permissions or licenses.  It is important to register any elements of a website that you wish to have protected under copyright law<a href="references.html#ref7" title="Website copyright"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.  Any such registered sections can include copyright notices as comments in the HTML or CSS files.
        </p>
        <h3>
            1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them
        </h3>
        <p>
            Those with visual impairments should be considered in the creation of a website.  Ensuring that any written text is in fact stored as text on the webpage allows for it to be scaled up without losing legibility which could be an issue if the text is stored as an image.  Using a colour scheme that does not conflict with common forms of colour blindness is also important as having the website be illegible to a portion of those viewing could result in a digital project failing.  If you do not intend on building a separate mobile website it is worth considering using percentage values when defining sizes and margins to allow for them to scale on mobile better.  It is good practice to include non-visible text descriptions of images for text-to-speech systems and in the case of them no loading in.
        </p>
        <h3>
            1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites
        </h3>
        <p>
            Appropriate filetypes depend on what coding language the website was written in.  The most common and thus most adopted filetypes to use are: HTML for the page content, CSS for any stylesheets, and JS for any finesse that requires the use of scripts.  Beyond that .txt files are a good idea to use for saving text locally and importing it as it does not include any formatting and so is at liberty of the relevant CSS file to format.  There are many appropriate image file types that can be used, the most common of which online are: PNG, JPEG(or JPG), and GIF.
        </p>
        <h3>
            1.8 Storing and retrieving files effectively
        </h3>
        <p>
            Any files that want to be read by the website should either be stored in the same directory as the files calling them to allow for them to be retrieved effectively.  Another option is to store them online and call the URL, however this relies on that website remaining publicly accessible.  In this project I stored all files in the same folder while working locally and then uploaded them to the same GitHub repository.

        <h3>
            2.1 Preparing appropriate content for your site
        </h3>
        <p>
            To prepare the content for this site I text files in Visual Studio Code to type answers to the questions asked in the project brief.  I could have, and perhaps should have, used a more writing oriented text editor for this so I had spelling and grammar checking natively instead of having to use a third party tool to do so.
        </p>
        <h3>
            2.2 Organise and combine information needed for webpages including different platforms
        </h3>
        <p>
            I chose to organise the information in the order it appears in the brief and use the subtitles in the brief so my responses would be read as answers.  I felt this was the most sensible and accessible way to fulfil the task.  By using HTML and CSS I ensured that my website will work on the majority of web browsing platforms.  I also made sure when researching additional features I could use to make sure that they worked natively in the majority of platforms.  In order to check this I checked the website across two different web browsers I had installed on my computer: Google Chrome and Firefox.  
        </p>
        <h3>
            2.3 Select and using appropriate editing and formatting techniques for clarity and good navigation
        </h3>
        <p>
            For good navigation I ensured the navigation bar was always visible at the top of the page.  As for editing tools I used a third party spell checker to ensure I did not make any glaring mistakes.  I believe the combination of these allows for a clear website that is easy to read and follow.
        </p>
        <h3>
            2.4 Select and use appropriate development techniques to link information across pages
        </h3>
        <p>
            The navigation bar allows for information to be linked across pages in a logical manner.  As well as this I used anchors in the pages to allow for easy navigation and jumping to different sections, I also used anchors for the references so they could be easily accessed.  I chose to do it like this as I felt anchors made for a better reading experience than using separate pages for each outcome or even question.

        <h3>
            2.5 Changing file formats for documents if necessary to display on your site
        </h3>
        <p>
            This was not relevant to my project as the only file called was already in the JPG format and thus widely adopted.
        </p>
        <h3>
            2.6 Error free pages that are fit for purpose
        </h3>
        <p>
            I encountered a few errors whilst building the website, mainly with the navigation bar, either with it not displaying correctly and using unintended formatting, or not filling the screen as I wanted it to.  I managed to return to the CSS file and locate the issues and subsequently fix them.  As of publication there are no known errors with the site.

            3.1 Test your site appropriately to make sure it works on different browsers and that everything works as planned
        </h3>
        <p>
            Whilst working on the project I kept the local files open in a Google Chrome window so I could see what effect the changes I was making had to ensure they had the desired effect.  Then once I had completed a significant portion I checked in Firefox for consistency and to see if an alternative browser threw up any unexpected errors.  I should have been doing this the entire time in case of any major incompatibility issues and this is something I will keep in mind on future projects.
        </p>
        <h3>
            3.2 Identify quality problems and respond to them accordingly
        </h3>
        <p>
            Upon testing the website in a different browser to the one I had predominantly been using I realised the the font I chose for the titles (Oswald) could be a little bit difficult to read so I searched for an alternative to use and settled on Lato.  Lato proved to be much easier to read and so a better choice for the titles.

            As I encountered issues I returned to the source code in order to establish where and what the issue was then did my best to fix it.  If I lacked the knowledge to solve the problem I turned to my peers or to Google in order to find a satisfactory solution.
