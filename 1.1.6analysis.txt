Trello
    helped break down the project into smaller easier to manage projects
    lets you see what is done/still to do at a glance
    would like the ability to nest tasks
VSCode
    has own debugger
    autofills suggested functions
    autofill brackets etc
    easy to use system
Chrome/firefox
    Chrome is my default browser so naturally want to use that to check the website works
    wanted secondary website to ensure it works as intended
