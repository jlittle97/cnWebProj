            1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business
        </h3>
        <p>
            IT is an integral part of all modern businesses regardless of whether their main platform is technology based or not.  Communication is a major part of IT in a modern business, as it allows the business to better communicate with employees, clients, and customers.  Email and video conferencing allow a business to communicate on a global scale<a href="references.html#ref1" title="The Six Important Business Objectives of Information Technology"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.  IT also makes logistics better for businesses, allowing them to plan projects using digital tools and to then share them to those who need them in a very efficient manner.  The monitoring and ordering of stock is another way in which IT is an asset to modern businesses, allowing for them to have easily editable spreadsheets of stock numbers and contact suppliers remotely at any time of the day.  Similarly the access to metrics used to analyse the business and find areas of improvement is simplified when using digital tools as productivity can be logged remotely and tracked with ease.  Being in a digital space makes access to a business' target audience easier than with traditional advertising methods through the use of targeted advertising<a href="references.html#ref2" title="The Importance of Information Technology In Business Today"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.

        <h3>
            1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully
        </h3>
        <p>
            There are many factors that go into the success of a digital project.  One of those is time management and separation of tasks, there are many digital tools that make this easier than with analogue methods, for example, I used Trello for this project to break it all down into smaller pieces and to manage what had and hadn't been down at any given point.  When working as part of a team for a digital project, the most important skill is communication; being able to discuss ideas together and to determine who is best at completing each section of the project is a necessity.  There are many skills that go into the delegation of such tasks, some of those are: coding ability (in a language relevant to the project), knowledge of the industry, and literacy in any relevant programs.
        </p>
        <h3>
            1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT
        </h3>
        <p>
            The task presented was to create this website, I decided I wanted to break it down into different pages for each unit and use subheadings on those pages to denote the outcomes and questions.  I wanted a navigation bar at the top of the pages giving easy access to other pages and, time permitting, add drop-downs to the navigation bar to give access to each outcome.  I broke the project down into many small tasks to more easily map what had to be done, I did this using Trello, the Trello board for this project can be found <a href="https://trello.com/b/BSmftFbb/codenationwebsiteproject" target="_blank">here</a>. The first task was to complete the questions so I had everything to put onto the website then I could worry about the appearance  of the page.  Once I was working on the website itself I had to decide on a theme for the site, including colour theme, backgrounds, and the appearance of the navigation bar.  After deciding on an overall theme I worked on the layout of each page.

        <h3>
            1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects
        </h3>
        <p>
            There are a number of factors that may cause a digital project to fail.  Perhaps the most obvious is the project generating insufficient income to balance the costs of its development, there are a number of ways this can happen; the project can be launched into an over-saturated market, or the product could be hard to find (if it has poor search engine optimisation for example)<a href="references.html#ref3" title="Four risks that will kill your digital project"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.  Not planning for post launch is another way in which a digital project can fail, this is because parts of the project can fall behind and obsolete parts remain, or where it is hosted by the creators then not preparing for higher levels of traffic than initial estimates to compensate for the project gaining popularity.  There can also be updates to key hardware/software to the project that require large parts to be reworked in order to adapt<a href="references.html#ref4" title="what is risk in a digital project and why should i care?"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.
        </p>
        <h3>
            1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software
        </h3>
        <p>
            Before deciding on any IT systems or software for a project you must first decide what format the project will be, will it be an app, a website, an extension, or something else?  Once you have established that you must know what hardware you're going to be running it on as this will have different limitations in what can be used in the creation of it.  Using what knowledge of systems you already have, and what you are comfortable in using decide which would be best suited for the project.  If you are not aware of any suitable systems then search for the industry standards for what you want to do.  In this project, for example, I chose to use Visual Studio Code as my text editor, Trello to plan the steps of the project, and Chrome/Firefox to test the website and ensure it appears as I intended it to.
        </p>
        <h3>
            1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes
        </h3>
        <p>
            As mentioned above my chosen technologies were: Trello for planning the project, Visual Studio Code as a text editor, and Chrome/Firefox as web browsers to check the website.  I chose Trello as it is an industry standard for use of the Kanban method, it allowed me to split the project into smaller tasks making it easier to manage, however I would have liked a system that allowed me to nest tasks to make visualising dependencies easier.  Visual Studio Code does everything I needed a text editor to do, it has a debugger for the languages I used for the project, and has auto-suggestions for terms and brackets.  Chrome is my default browser and so was an easy choice for a browser to use to test the website as I worked, I chose to use Firefox as a second browser to check in as it is a commonly used browser; I initially wanted to use Safari as it is the 2nd most popular browser<a href="references.html#ref5" title="The best web browsers for 2020"><sup>[5]</sup></a> however Safari for Windows is no longer supported by Apple and I do not have access to an Apple machine.

        <h3>
            1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects
        </h3>
        <p>
            Depending on where a website is based, or where its audience can have an impact on what legal regulations are in effect on it, I will focus on discussing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as it impacts any website that can be visited from the European Union.  The GDPR focuses on minimisation and accuracy of stored data, as well as accountability for this storing said data.  A digital project must be transparent with its user base about what information is tracked and who it is shared with in order to be GDPR compliant.  It must also give the individual the ability to opt out of having their data shared as they are in charge of their own data<a href="references.html#ref6" title="Guide to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)"><sup>[6]</sup></a>.

            Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful
        </p>
        <h3>
            2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed â€“ in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Overall I have been very happy with the tools I chose for this project.  I have found Visual Studio Code to be a great text editor and I wish I had had it for projects I have worked on previously!  As mentioned before however I would have liked an alternative to Trello that allows the nesting of tasks in a way that shows dependencies.
        </p>
        <h3>
            2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate
        </h3>
        <p>
            Visual Studio Code was an appropriate text editor for this project as it has many features that making writing code easier than in other editors, such as a debugger, support for many different file types, and auto-completion for functions and brackets.  Trello was also an appropriate tool, making using the Kanban method simple and easy to navigate.
        </p>
        <h3>
            2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project
        </h3>
        <p>
            My main goal was to create a website I considered to be professional and easy to use.  I believe I achieved this through the use of the styles and structure I used.  The text is easily legible on the transparent background and the background image has enough interesting features to draw attention without detracting from the content.  I feel that perhaps I should have separated the outcomes into different pages, however with the way they link together I stand by my decision to include all of unit 1 on one page and all of unit 2 on another.  I do however wish I had been able to allocate time to rewrite the navigation bar to allow for dropdown menus to jump to the different outcomes for easier navigation.  Overall I am happy with the website and I consider the project to be a success.
        </p>
        <h3>
            2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project
        </h3>
        <p>
            Two large improvements I would like to make to the project would be to include smooth scrolling to the jump points on each page and also to introduce mobile compatibility.  Unfortunately these features did not fall within the scope of the curriculum and I did not allocate time to research them myself so that they could be included in the project, instead using the time for self learning to teach myself how to set up in page links and to create the navigation bar in the manner I did.
        </p>
        <p>
            An additional improvement I would like to include is to use dropdowns in the navigation bar to easily jump to different outcomes.  However, I decided on wanting to do this towards the end of the project after already implementing a working navigation bar and was unable to find a working method to implement dropdowns into it so would have had to reword the navigation bar in order to include dropdowns which did not fall as a priority in the limited time remaining.

            Due to my decision to use the different outcomes and sections as sub headings I believe I have met requirements and that it is all fit for purpose.

            3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency
        </h3>
        <p>
            As previously mentioned one drawback in the tools I used was the inability to nest tasks in Trello, I believe that this would have helped me organise my Trello board in a better fashion, making it easier to read thus improving productivity.  Using Visual Studio Code was very efficient for me, being able to jump between different files effortlessly and even display them side by side made writing everything very simple.  Having multiple monitors also led to a higher efficiency than if I only had one. being able to see the code, the website and the brief side by side and of decent sizes made troubleshooting and ensuring that all the content was present a breeze.
        </p>
        <h3>
            3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
        </h3>
        <p>
            A way in which productivity could have been improved further in this project would be to have worked as a team to complete it.  Being able to divide tasks to members based on their skills allows for a drastic increase in productivity as you limit the amount of in-project learning that must be undertaken.  Obviously team work is not always a possibility and I am glad I was able to undertake this project alone as I learned a lot in doing it.  As stated though, not having to research methods would have increased the efficiency of the project.
        </p>
        <h3>
            3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects
        </h3>
        <p>
            In order to improve my own productivity in future projects I will strive for open channels of communication with the client allowing for fast input and revisions to avoid spending unnecessary time working on areas of the project that do not need it.  Next time I will also establish more of the planning before jumping in to avoid issues such as that that I had with the navigation bar.
        </p>
        <h3>
            3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
        </h3>
        <p>
            In order to test digital solutions I would try them in personal projects first not only to ensure that they work in a practical manner but also to see whether they work for me in a personal manner as not all solutions are appropriate for all people.  The best way to test something is by doing as there may be unforeseen issues that come about when putting the solutions into practice and the only way to learn of these is by encountering them.  By being able to adapt quickly this allows for solutions to said unforeseen issues without too much of a dip in productivity.  Having counter measures in place for in case things do not work as intended is another great way to prevent drops of productivity.
